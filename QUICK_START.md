## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Local server won't start"**
```bash
cd mujoco_wasm
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**"No AI decisions in console"**
- Wait 2 seconds (decisions happen every 120 frames)
- Check for errors in console
- Verify internet connection (needs to call Gemini API)

**"Vercel deployment failed"**
- Check vercel.json is in root directory
- Ensure mujoco_wasm folder exists
- Try: `vercel --prod --force`
